<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Thru-beam Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emitter</li><li>Receiver</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrasonic thru-beam sensor market consists of two primary types: emitters and receivers. Emitters generate ultrasonic waves that travel through the air. When these waves encounter an object, they are reflected back. Receivers detect these reflected waves, determining the objectâ€™s presence and distance. The emitter sends a continuous signal while the receiver interprets the reflected sound, allowing for precise object detection in various applications, including automation, safety systems, and industrial process control.</p></p>
